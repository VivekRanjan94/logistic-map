# Logistic Map

## Access the site [here](https://vivekranjan94.github.io/logistic-map/)

The logistic map is a recurrence relation of degree 2 defined by the formula

### x(n+1) = r\*x(n)\*(1 - x(n)).

It was initially designed to model a population where xn+1 is the new population relative to the maximum capacity after a year, xn is the previous population relative to the maximum.  
The population grows at a rate of r and due to environmental constraints, linearly decreases at a rate inversely proportional to xn.
